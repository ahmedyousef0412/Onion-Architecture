# ðŸ§… OnionCartDemo

A clean and maintainable **.NET 9 Web API** built using the **Onion Architecture pattern**, demonstrating core principles like separation of concerns, dependency inversion, and domain-driven design.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

**Onion Architecture** is a **domain-centric approach** that keeps the business logic at the core  and makes the system **independent of frameworks, databases, and external systems**.

This demo simulates a simple **shopping cart system** with:
- **Cart**, **CartItem**, and **Product** entities
- **Domain Services** for business rules
- **Application Services** for use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer** using EF Core
- **Web API Layer** for presentation
